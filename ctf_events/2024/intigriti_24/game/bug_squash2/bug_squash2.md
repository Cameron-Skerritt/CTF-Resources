# Bug Squash (part 2)

## Video walkthrough

[![VIDEO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dEA68Aa0V-s/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dEA68Aa0V-s "Bypassing Server-side Anti-Cheat Protections")

## Challenge Description

> The developers learned some important things about cheaters and now hope they've learnt their lesson. Rumour has it, if you score more than 100,000 points in this game (within the 2 min time limit), you'll get a flag. Watch out for that new anti-cheat system though!

I'll improve the writeup! check the video walkthrough too ðŸ˜Š

## Solution

-   Description indicates need more than 100,000 points to win
-   Setup Windows proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
-   Setup burp cert to capture HTTPS traffic
    -   Export proxy cert in PKCS format
    -   `Windows > Manage user certificates > Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates > All Tasks > Import`
    -   Traffic will now show in burp
-   Try to modify the traffic, to change the points but there are some conditions:
    -   Anti-cheat resets users score if they send more then 3 request per second
    -   Anti-cheat rejects any point values that aren't 1 (and resets)
    -   Anti-cheat checks that players score didn't jump to an unrealistic number (more than 4096 per request)
        -   Game resets every 2 mins (so by the anti-cheat rules, max they can get is (120 \* 3))
-   The thing about JSON is the [keys are non case-sensitive](https://www.quora.com/Is-JSON-case-sensitive), so you could send `BUGS_SQUASHED` instead of `bugs_squashed` and it wouldn't treated the same.
-   However, if you give that a go, you'll see it _is_ treated the same. It gives a point regardless of the case sensitivity. What if you try and send multiple of the _same_ key but with different case, all while adhering to the 3 requests per second and 1 bug per squash limit!
-   So yes, intended solution is to send `{"user_id": "insert_id", "bugs_squashed": 1, "bUgs_squashed": 1, "buGs_squashed": 1}` etc, where you can send max 4096 variations per request, max 3 requests per second.. Will need to use custom fuzzing script/limit intruder to the anti-cheat requirements

        while score < target_score:
            score = update_score(session, user_id, variations)
            time.sleep(0.333)  # 3 requests per second
